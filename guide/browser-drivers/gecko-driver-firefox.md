Firefox driver is included in the selenium-server-standalone.jar available in the Selenium downloads. The driver comes in the form of an xpi (firefox extension) which is added to the firefox profile when you start a new instance of FirefoxDriver.

### Available CLI arguments
These can be found on the [FirefoxDriver page] (https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/FirefoxDriver#Important_System_Properties).

Settings for the Firefox profile, which can be set via the desiredCapabilities, can be found [**here**](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#settings).
